I am Venkat, a Supply Chain professional exploring the intersection of **Logistics, Python, and AI**. 

This lab is a technical space for **'Art of the Possible'** tinkering—focusing on raw problems, technical architecture, and specific benefits without the hype.

### **Current Focus Areas**
* **Agentic Rerouting:** Using NVIDIA cuOpt for real-time logistics.
* **Federated Learning:** Secure data sharing in SCM.
* **Visualizing Logic:** Moving from spreadsheets to agentic workflows.
