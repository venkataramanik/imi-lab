I am Venkat, a Supply Chain professional exploring the intersection of **Logistics, Python, and AI**. 

This lab is a personal technical space for **'Art of the Possible'** tinkering. I focus on raw supply chain problems, technical architecture/API logic, and specific benefits—without the hype or jargon.

### **Current Focus Areas**
* **Agentic Rerouting:** Utilizing Python and NVIDIA cuOpt for real-time logistics optimization.
* **Federated Learning:** Architecting secure, decentralized data sharing for SCM.
* **Visualizing Logic:** Transitioning legacy spreadsheet workflows into autonomous agentic systems.
